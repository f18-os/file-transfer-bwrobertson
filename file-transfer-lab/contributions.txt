I received no help from classmates.

I read the following forums and websites for help with this lab.

There are two versions of this lab I have uploaded.

echo and file.

Echo is using Dr. Freudenthal's code.
fileClient/Server is made from scratch from reading forums and tutorials. Basically these sites gave me a better understanding of what sockets are and how to use them and where to place the fork command to avoid a fork bomb (which I had extensive trouble with before).
