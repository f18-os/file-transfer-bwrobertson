Ben Robertson

I received no help from classmates.

I read the following forums for help with this lab.

https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1394838
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28840624/forking-server-in-python
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27241804/sending-a-file-over-tcp-sockets-in-python

There are two versions of this lab I have uploaded.

echo and ben.

Echo is using Dr. Freudenthal's code.
Ben is made from scratch from reading forums. I have borrowed some code from the forums but have added pieces to it to improve on what the code was originally designed to do. Basically this code game me a better understanding of what sockets are and how to use them and where to place the fork command to avoid a fork bomb (which I had extensive trouble with before).
