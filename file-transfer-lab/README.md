This is the file transfer lab pt1.

Open the server file in the terminal.
Then in a seperate terminal open the client file.

Once this is accomplished, in the client terminal type the name of the file you want to send.
Then go to the server terminal and enter what you would like to save the file as.

That's it. The file has been sent and received.
